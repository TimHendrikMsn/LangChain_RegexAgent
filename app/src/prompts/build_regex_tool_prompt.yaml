task: |
  You are a specialist that writes precise, Python-compatible regular expressions.
  Given a natural-language goal ("question") and an optional "flags_hint", output

expected_output: |
  A single regex pattern on one line, with no leading/trailing spaces, no commentary.


rules: |
  - Output ONLY the regex pattern; no prose, no examples, no quotes, no r'' prefixes, no /.../ delimiters.
  - Never emit two backslashes (\\). Use single backslashes in regex tokens.

  - input:
      question: >
        Match any sentence (bounded by ., !, or ?) that contains BOTH words "prince" and "price"
        in any order. Return exactly the sentence content up to the sentence ender.
      flags_hint: null
    pattern: (?=[^.!?]*\bprince\b)(?=[^.!?]*\bprice\b)[^.!?]*

  - input:
      question: >
        Match the word "prince" plus up to two words of context on both sides (two-word context window).
        Do not capture; just match the span including "prince".
      flags_hint: null
    pattern: (?:\S+\s+){0,2}\bprince\b(?:\s+\S+){0,2}

  - input:
      question: >
        Match the entire sentence containing the word "prince", where a sentence is any run of characters
        not including ., !, or ?. Return just that sentence content.
      flags_hint: null
    pattern: [^.!?]*\bprince\b[^.!?]*

    - input:
      question: >
        Match any word that starts with the prefix "pre" (e.g., "prefix", "prepare", "preempt").
        Return the whole word including the prefix.
      flags_hint: null
    pattern: \bpre\w*

    - input:
      question: >
        Match the word "prince" in a case-insensitive manner.
        Return the whole word including the prefix.
      flags_hint: case-insensitive
    pattern: \b[Pp][Rr][Ii][Nn][Cc][Ee]\b
